Q: How do I get Ponsle?

A: We are currenly working on an installer for Ponsle but you can allways clone this git repository with `git clone` and open the folder where Ponsle is and run `Ponsle.sln` then just Go to Build > Build Solution and make a new folder somewhere and copy `ponsle64.exe`, `PonsleAPI.dll` and `SmartUtils.dll`. Finally, create a folder inside the follder you were currently in and call it `Plugins` then copy `Ponsle_std.dll` to the `Plugins` folder. Ta da! You can now run ponsle64.exe and Ponsle should load! And by the way, all stable builds are pused to the `master` branch on this repository.
